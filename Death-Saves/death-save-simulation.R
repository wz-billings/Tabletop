# DND death probability ####
# When your HP goes to zero, you start making death saving throws.
# You die when you get three failures, which is a roll of 10 or less. However,
# a 1 counts as two failures so the probability is slightly higher than
# a naive estimate with no extra rules.

# However, we can't just look at the probability of three rolls because it's
# possible for someone to make up to five death saving throws -- two fails and
# three successes or two successes and three fails. Or if you get a 20,
# you automatically live.

# While calculating the possibility analytically is possible, it's much easier
# to code a simulation and run it multiple times.
